# SystemKeeperBot

System keeper works is in a way similar as Liquidator. It tracks the same events on native chain. After each event it checks Agent's position and either starts or ends liquidation process.

File [SystemKeeper.ts](../src/actors/SystemKeeper.ts) contains framework for such actor in FAsset system.

### Initialization

Initially, the constructor takes in **runner** (ScopedRunner), **address** (native address), **state** (TrackedState) as inputs:

```javascript
   constructor(
       public runner: ScopedRunner,
       public address: string,
       public state: TrackedState
   ) { }
```

## SystemKeeperBot Automation

The **runStep** method is responsible for managing all relevant Agent events and comprises:

-   **registerEvents**

### registerEvents

Initially, it triggers event handling in **parent** (TrackedState) with method **readUnhandledEvents**.

Secondly, it checks following events:

-   **PriceEpochFinalized**:
    -   verifies whether liquidation for any agent should be initiated or terminated based on their recently calculated collateral ratios
-   **MintingExecuted**:
    -   verifies whether liquidation for agent should be initiated or terminated based on its recently calculated collateral ratios
